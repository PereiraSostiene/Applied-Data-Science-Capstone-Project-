1. Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

"The Restaurant Battle of Neighborhoods in Mexico City"

Mexico City is one of the top places to visit in the world. It has many touristic places such as the historic center (designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site), 
colonial-era churches, El Templo Mayor (which preserves vestiges of the great Aztec empire), incredible museums, the Chapultepec Park, and many others. 

Mexico City also possesses an extraordinary gastronomy, but for tourist locating the right place to eat can be complicated and challenging. 
Once, a friend of mine from India visited Mexico City for a conference. He asked me to show him the city, which I gladly did. 
Everything was great for us until he told me he was a vegan. I did not know where to find a restaurant for vegans! 
Mexican food is spicy, and the most delicious meals include beef or pork, which is a problem for many people around the world because of cultural, religious or health reasons. 

Then, the purpose of this data science project is to help tourists in Mexico City to find restaurants of their preference, 
that is, in which neighborhoods of Mexico City they will find different types of restaurants (Fast food, Vegetarian food, Italian, Japanese and so on).
